# AI-Based-Multi-Sign-Language-Converter-for-speech-and-Text-Communication
The AI-Based Multi Sign Language Converter is an innovative solution aimed at improving communication between hearing individuals and those who are deaf or hard of hearing. This project uses artificial intelligence to convert spoken language and typed text into corresponding sign language gestures, helping to bridge the gap in daily interactions, education, and public services.

This system supports both speech-to-sign and text-to-sign conversions. It employs speech recognition technologies to capture real-time spoken input and translate it into sign language, and it can also interpret written text for the same purpose. The sign language output is delivered either through animated avatars or visual gesture representations, making it accessible and easy to understand.

One of the key features of this tool is multi-language sign support, including popular sign languages like American Sign Language (ASL), British Sign Language (BSL), and Indian Sign Language (ISL). This makes the tool adaptable for global use and inclusive for diverse communities.

Under the hood, the system integrates deep learning models for natural language understanding and gesture synthesis. It uses technologies such as computer vision (e.g., MediaPipe or OpenPose) for accurate gesture detection and rendering, speech recognition APIs for capturing voice input, and natural language processing (NLP) models like BERT for understanding context.

This converter has a wide range of applications, including assistive communication for individuals with hearing impairments, sign language education tools, and accessibility features in public systems. It can also be deployed in customer service environments or emergency services where inclusive communication is essential.
